# Divine Delivery

Divine Delivery is a competitive speedrun-based gamemode for ULTRAKILL.

Deliver presents and clear rooms to stave off the constantly draining time; clear as many as you can to earn a spot on the leaderboard.

## Donate
It costs me money to keep the leaderboard server up every month, and I'm not old enough to get a job, so if you're feeling generous, you can [subscribe to my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Waff1e) to help keep it up and get early access to updates for my other mods.

## Note
I made this mod in just over a week, so it might be a bit buggy.
Updates are planned, with new rooms, balance changes, and bug fixes.

## Usage
The mode can be accessed by the gift button next to The Cyber Grind in the act selection menu.
